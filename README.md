# Countrywide-Investment-Strategy
A slideshow, tableau workbook, and supporting files offering insights and explanations on optimal investment strategies based off education level, age, and median income for every county in the United States.

The powerpoint is essentially our analysis and insights. It has every relevant graph and explanations for our data and findings. The Tableau workbook is where we generated all the graphs used in the powerpoint. The excel file is our final data source. The SQL file is where we combined sperate datasets to make the final dataset.
